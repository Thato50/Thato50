# 👋 Hi, I'm Thato!

## 💻 Junior Software Developer | Building Cool Stuff with Code

I'm a software developer who loves turning ideas into functional web applications. Currently leveling up through GirlCode's NQF 5 learnership, where I've gone from "Hello World" to building real projects that people can actually use.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about coding. Or debugging. Mostly debugging. 😅

🎓 **Certified in:** Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) & GitHub Foundations
